            Panang is spelled in various ways: phanaeng, phanang, panaeng or panang, or as penang, or Pulau Pinang in Malay. This red curry originates from an island located off the west coast of Malaysia.
            Panang curry is usually less spicy as the paste is made with lesser red chilies compared to Thai curries. Peanuts (in ground form mostly) and coconut milk makes the curry sweeter than other Thai curries.
            Panang curry is richer, sweeter and creamier than the more herbaceous Thai curry.
