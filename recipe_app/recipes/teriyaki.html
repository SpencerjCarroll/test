        <h1>Teriyaki Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../asserts/teriyaki.jpg" alt="teriyaki chicken">
        <p>
            Teriyaki is derived from the Japanese root words teri, to shine, and yaki, to broil or grill.
            Thats the way traditional teriyaki looks: shiny and incised with grill marks. In Japan, teriyaki
            is a mix of soy sauce, sake and the rice wine mirin, which imparts a subtle sweetness. The teriyaki
            found throughout Seattle, of which this is an adaptation, is a bit more showy. Cooks sweeten with
            white sugar and pineapple juice. They thicken with cornstarch. Ginger and garlic go into the mix
            because of the Korean ancestry of many cooks. It is not at all traditional, but it is simple to
            prepare and addictive to eat. Be sure to plan ahead as you do need to marinate the chicken before
            cooking. An overnight stay in the fridge is ideal, but many readers have been happy with a quick
            marinade of an hour or so.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic(pressed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>.25 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3-inch cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>tablespoon pineapple juice</li>
            <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except cornstarch and chicken. Bring to boil 
                over high heat. Reduce heat to low and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. 
                Remove from heat and let cool. Discard cinnamon stick and mix in .5 cup water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken in a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. Add soy sauce mixture, seal
                bag, and turn to coat chicken. Refrigerate for at least an hour, ideally overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove chicken and set aside. Pour mixture into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high
                heat, then reduce heat to low. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and add to pan. Stir
                until mixture begins to thicken, and gradually stir in enough water (about .5 cup) until sauce
                is the consistency of heavy cream. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat a broiler or grill. Lightly brush chicken pieces on all sides with sauce, and broil
                or grill about 3 minutes per side. While chicken is cooking, place sauce over high heat and
                bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer, adding water a bit at a time to keep mixture
                at a pourable consistency. To serve, slice chicken into strips, arrange on plates, and drizzle with sauce.
